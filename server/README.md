# Library Book Management API

This is a simple API system for managing books in a library. The system provides 5 endpoints for creating, updating, deleting and retrieving books.

## Installation

1. Install Java 13 or higher version
2. From the jar directory, run:

   ```bash
   java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

3. Wait for the application to start.

Note: The application uses an in-memory database. Data persists only while the application is running. Stopping the application will clear all data, so create your test data before testing.

## Access

The application will be available at: `http://localhost:7081`

## Authentication

Two users are available:

- Username: `admin` (full access to all APIs)
- Username: `user` (access to POST and GET APIs only)
- Password: `password` (same for both users)
